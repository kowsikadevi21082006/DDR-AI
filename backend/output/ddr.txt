**Detailed Diagnostic Report (DDR)**

**Property Issue Summary:**
The inspection and thermal reports indicate that Green Heights building is generally safe with some minor issues requiring attention. The main concerns include outdated staircase lighting and a critical issue with Machine D, which requires maintenance.

**Area-wise Observations:**

1. **General Safety**: 
- Fire extinguishers are available on all floors and emergency exit signs are functional, indicating a favorable safety status.
- Smoke detectors are installed and working, but their specific locations and performance are not mentioned.

2. **Staircase Lighting**:
- On the 3rd floor, staircase lighting is reported as needing replacement, posing a minor safety concern.

3. **Thermal Performance**:
- Machine D's temperature reading (75°C) has exceeded the warning level, which suggests inadequate thermal performance or potential issues with the equipment, indicating a Medium High Risk.

**Probable Root Cause:**
Based on available information, the most likely causes of these issues include:

- Outdated staircase lighting likely caused by equipment degradation or human error.
- Machine D's high temperature might be related to equipment aging, improper maintenance, or design faults.

**Severity Assessment (with reasoning):**
The overall severity of these issues is rated as Medium. 

- Staircase lighting issue is relatively minor but still essential for safety and maintenance.
- Machine D's performance concerns appear to be more critical, as it could potentially cause damage to other equipment or pose a safety risk if not addressed.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Staircase Lighting Replacement**: 
- Schedule a replacement for the faulty staircase lighting on the 3rd floor.
- Recommend the replacement of older lighting fittings to prevent future failures.

2. **Machine D Maintenance and Inspection**:
- Schedule a maintenance check for Machine D to identify and rectify the root cause of the high temperature.
- Review the cooling system and performance parameters for Machine D based on the manufacturer's recommendations.

3. **Thermal Performance Monitoring**: 
- Schedule regular temperature checks to monitor the thermal performance of all machines and address potential issues promptly.

**Additional Notes:**
- To fully address these issues and identify potential vulnerabilities, conduct a general building safety audit focusing on fire security measures, smoke detection systems, and general building structure performance.
- Implement a regular maintenance schedule for mechanical equipment to prevent future issues.

**Missing or Unclear Information:**
None is explicitly mentioned, although additional detailed specifications about smoke detectors' installation, location, and operational parameters are not available.
